<p align="center"> I like robotics and apparently so does my sister. So this serves as a good tool to nurture that interest. The UX is inspired by the dji tello.

## üõ† The Build <a name = "build"></a>
The body is a EEZYbotARM MK2, which can be found on thingiverse, with version 2 of the base. You can watch Chris Reilys youtube video on how to assemble it.

#### Parts List
 - 3 MG995 Servos
 - 1 SG90 Servo
 - 1 ESP32 Dev Board
 - 5 WS2812B leds
 - 5v power supply

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
The ESP32 is runing micropython and the frontend application is build with Vuejs. Having a basic understanding of electronics and microcontrollers will help with troubleshooting and further customizing it. I also use thonny ide to edit the code, you can use any text editor and esptool will need to be installed.

### Installing
- After cloning the respository you need to flash the latest version of micropython onto your board 
  - [Instructions](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/)

- Next install esptool.py on your computer
```python
pip install esptool.py
```
- Now update board/config.ini to further customize the robot to your liking

To check if everything worked see if the led lights light up when you connect to power.
